    I’ve been developing games for the past five years, with a focus on combining conceptually interesting systems games with 
    mechanically satisfying, fast-paced action style games. I’m interested in joining a company or team as a gameplay, UI, or systems programmer.
    Below is a sample of some of my work:

          Sun Spear began as a student project created by a team of four over the course of ten weeks, and we plan to release it 
          on steam by fall 2023. This 3rd person 3D adventure game follow Bonnie as she battles against the forces of evil and 
          darkness in order to save her village. <br><br>

          Bonnie has a magical spear that can be thrown or used in melee range, and there is an explosion ability which can damage 
          enemies and throw them back. Over the course of the ~60 minute playtime, the player will face off against four distinct 
          enemy types and three bosses that stand in their way. The game plays out over the course of a single day, with the aesthetics, 
          post-processing, and lighting cycling through four different times.
